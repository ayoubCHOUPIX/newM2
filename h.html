                <p>
                    There’s always debate about who’s the greatest football player of all time. 
                    Pele was the first to be unanimously awarded 
                    that title and those who’ve seen him play call him the finest ever.
                    Despite never playing for a European club, Pele’s legacy remains as strong as ever. 
                    For all of the modern football greats, he is the ghost to chase as the dreams of emulating him 
                    reverberate in every football player on the planet.

                <h2>DIEGO MARADONA</h2>
                <p>
                    The last time Argentina won the World Cup was in 1986 and the man who led them to
                     the title was ‘El Magico’, Diego Armando Maradona.
                    Widely notorious for his short-temper but also worshipped by many for his amazing talent, 
                    Maradona was the ultimate maverick. He could dribble past players like a hot knife through butter.
                     He could pick out a teammate with a fantastic pass 
                    that would leave defenses stunned and he could produce moments of magic on a daily basis.

                <h2>JOHAN CRUYFF</h2>
                <p>
                    Born in Amsterdam, Cruyff was the crown jewel of football in the Netherlands 
                    and was the catalyst in the European nation’s rise to football royalty. 
                    When Rinus Michels developed his game of totaalvoetball,
                     Cruyff was the deep-lying forward who made the formation and strategy tick.
